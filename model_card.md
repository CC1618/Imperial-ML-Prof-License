# Model Card

## Model Description

### Input:
Stationary time series of technical indicators derived from close price of equity indices of the last 30 years.

### Output:
Three classes indicating a peak (+1), a trough (-1) or neutral (0) in the next N days. A peak in a financial time series is an instance when the value of an asset reaches its highest level of trading over a certain period of time. A trough is a point of low activity and represents the bottom of a period of decline in a financial assetâ€™s value.

### Model:
Several classifiers are available to be tested with different ways to normalise,
standardise and reduce the number of features. Sklearn enables us to build ML
pipelines like Legos, which enables us find the best classification algorithm.

### Resutls:
If you apply the training, fitting, and evaluation only on the SPX Index you observe the peaks are much more difficult to predict than troughs. The error is much higher, and it misses most of the true values. One way to mitigate is to include in the fitting and the other indices. However, when doing so, you will pick most of the peaks which is good, but the signal will be much more sensitive and the number of false positive will go out of the roof. One way to mitigate would be to stack several classifiers togethers as weak learners, and use their outputs as inputs for a strong classifiers, which would learn from the outputs of the weak ones.
